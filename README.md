# Aurora
Aurora is an ambient light system built with an HDMI switch, and HDMI capture card, a Raspberry Pi and an LED strip. There is a full writeup of how this came to be at https://www.andrewmohawk.com/2021/05/25/aurora-ambient-lighting/ and a build guide at https://www.andrewmohawk.com/2021/05/24/aurora-how-to-build/

# Help
Feel free to submit PRs for the project to improve the code base or add your own visualisations. Please remember to update the VERSION when you are doing a new PR. If you *need* help with any part of the project feel free to email or you can join the gitter at https://gitter.im/AuroraAmbientLighting/community 

# Extending
While the documentation for extending and building your own hasnt been fully written up, the TL;DR is to copy the example extenion in the `extensions` folder, change the metadata and restart Aurora with `sudo service aurora restart`, once it has picked up the new file you can simply make changes and then click load extension in the main interface. 

Please note when changing your `visualise` function you need to make it non-locking or the interface will not be able to communicate with it. The interface will pause for 0.01s before running visualise() again between each run

# Install
The install for this requires a hardware and software setup. You can follow the install guide at https://www.andrewmohawk.com/2021/05/24/aurora-how-to-build/ 

The flow diagram looks as follows:
